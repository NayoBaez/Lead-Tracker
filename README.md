# LINK SAVER

This link saver & organizer helps you save time by storing your links onto your local storage with one click of a button. Developed in raw JavaScript using the LocalStorage() property to store the browsers data locally. The data is fetched from the Chrome API, turned into a string with JSON.stringify then parsed back into an array with the JSON.parse property and rendered out onto the DOM using a For loop.

I am learning so much while building this extension, working with data attributes is also something I had never worked with before. It helped me to easily extract code without violating the DOM rules. The event.target references the button that was clicked, which gived the element information to identify which button it is. This way the user can copy or remove the correct index. 


## Features in progress:

- New Interface 
- Drag & Drog to organize links 
- Edit Links - give them a custom name
- Categorize links in to custom collection
